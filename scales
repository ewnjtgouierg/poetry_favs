1. music instrument and culture developed partially isolated in different regions

what was the same everywhere was the laws of physics and, to a degree, how humans perceive sound

obvious and uniform even if developed independent was octave:
the note with double frequency, then double of double and so on feels is "same" even while higher,
it has the same "meaning"
#demo:
clean do re mi fa mi re do
end with lower do while singing the one from the initial octave
then try doing the same with different note
then play with octaves - the meaning kinds of same, though sound changes - more like organ

there's a shepard scale - the illusion effect, that uses this feature of octaves to carefully substitute a note with its lower octave to create an illusion of perpetual scale / melody

a melody:

then play with smaller intervals to show how it changes the mood, compared to octave

so two notes with octave interval between them have this property of having the same meaning

and it's same in all music traditions

and the difference between them is how the octave is divided - into how many notes, and with which intervals between them

however, it's not completely arbitrary - you cannot just divide however you want
because human tend to perceive certain intervals as good, consonant, and others - as dissonant
although it's not strict, and can even change in time with traditions - like sept chord that was used more and more
still - show septima with the same do-re-mi
generally

the western tradition that we know, divides octave into 12 equal intervals

and musicians of course noticed that different notes would combine in some interesting ways

but how to divide it into different notes between them?






the same were the rules of physics
